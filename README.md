# User Authentication System

This repository contains PHP files for a basic user authentication system.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the `DBoperations` class, which is implemented in another repository. You can find the `DBoperations` class [here](https://github.com/ziadadel001/DatabaseOperations).

## Description


**This system is a simple authentication system designed for user authentication based on their username and password only.** It consists of several PHP files that handle user login, registration, and logout.

**You also have the option to use a file controller to handle all functions seamlessly, consolidating them into a single file for improved organization and maintenance.**
